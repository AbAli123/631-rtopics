## R Lecture Materials

The R lecture materials are here so that they are accessible outside of Canvas.

## RMarkdown

These files are either RMarkdown or generated from RMarkdown.

## Github

This Markdown file is part of a Git repository (repo) which is stored on GitHub.  Git keeps all of the files in these directories under version control and GitHub is a web-based platform build on top of Git, much like RStudio is build on top of R.  

GitHub repos can be loaded ("cloned") as a project in RStudio, but we need to set up RStudio:

* First [install git first](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git/).
* Then [make sure that RStudio can use git](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git-with-rstudio/)
* In RStudio go to File -> New Project ... -> Version Control -> Git
  * for repository url put "https://github.com/abecode/631-rtopics"
  * for project directory name put "clone-of-631-rtopics" (this you
    can modify to a name of your liking)
  * for "Create project as subdirectory of" use Downloads (or other
    directory of your choosing)
  * choose "open in new session" if you want RStudio to keep your old
    session



Forking is a more advanced GitHub technique that will copy someone's repo to your own account. Forking is more advanced than simply cloning. Cloning is fine if it's your repo or if you only plan to read/download/"pull" from someone else's repo.  However, forking is important for collaborating because it allows one to write/upload/"push" changes to your own repo and then share it back to the original repo. It is a kind of social feature Github adds to git.
